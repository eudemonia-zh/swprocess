swprocess Documentation
=======================

`swprocess` is a Python package for surface wave processing.
It includes features for performing active-source surface wave
processing (i.e., mulitchannel analysis of surface wave (MASW))
and tools for post-processing passive-wavefield surface wave
data (i.e., microtremor array measurements (MAM)) processed using
the open-source software Geopsy.

This package is still under development, so if you do not see a feature you
would like it may very well be under development and released in
the near future. To be notified of future releases, you can either
``watch`` the repository on
`Github <https://github.com/jpvantassel/swprocess>`_ or
``Subscribe to releases`` on the
`Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.org/project/swprocess/>`_.
